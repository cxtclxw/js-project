  "ingredients": [
    "8 slices regular bacon",
    "1/4 cup mayonnaise",
    "1 tablespoon ketchup",
    "2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish",
    "1/2 head of lettuce",
    "1 large tomato",
    "4 burger buns",
    "2 tablespoon mustard",
    "1 pound lean ground beef",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons salt",
    "1 teaspoon pepper",
    "2 tablespoons oil",
    "4 slices of cheese"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400ÂºF. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange 8 bacon slices in a single layer on the foil. Bake until browned and crisp, 19 to 20 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the toppings and cook the burger patties. Place 1/4 cup mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon ketchup, and 2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish in a small bowl and stir to combine.",
    "Remove the leaves from 1/2 medium head iceberg lettuce until you have 8 burger-sized leaves. Using a serrated knife, slice 1 beefsteak tomato crosswise into 4 slices. Split 4 hamburger buns and spread 2 tablespoons yellow mustard on the cut sides of the top buns, evenly spreading it to the edges.",
    "Divide 1 pound ground chuck into 4 portions, then form each portion into a ball. Press each ball, and season well with salt and pepper.",
    "Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet (at least 12 inches wide) or griddle over medium-high heat until shimmering. (If using a smaller skillet, cook the buns and burgers in 2 batches.) Tilt the pan so the oil coats the bottom. Place the mustard buns in the pan mustard-side down, gently press down on them, and cook until toasty and browned in spots, 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate.",
    "Place the bottom buns cut-side down in the pan and cook until golden brown and toasted, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to the plate with the mustard buns. Reserve the pan.",
    "Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Tilt the pan to coat the bottom with oil. Add the burger patties (cook in 2 batches if needed) and press on each patty with the back of a flat spatula. Cook until the bottoms are deeply browned and the patty is halfway cooked, about 2 1/2 minutes. Flip the burgers and place 1 slice of cheese on each patty. Cook for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes more, depending on desired burger doneness.",
    "Transfer to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, spread the mayonnaise mixture on the cut sides of the bottom buns, spreading to the edges.",
    "Assemble the burgers: Place a patty on each bottom bun. Top each patty with 4 bacon pieces, 1 tomato slice, 2 lettuce leaves, and the top bun.",
    "Enjoy!"
